# work_day_scheduler

Create an array for work hours.

Make sure that when the save button is clicked it saves the event text in the local storage for the specific time the event was entered.

When the page is refreshed the events continues to be saved.
Depending on the hours of the day corresponds to the color for past- gray, present-red and future-green.

Create for loop so every work hour presented on the scheduler has the same effect where it saves the event in the local storage.
